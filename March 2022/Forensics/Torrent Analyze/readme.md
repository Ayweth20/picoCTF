**Description:**  
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.  
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded?  
The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`. [Captured traffic](.//).

**Hints:**  
> Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
> You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols
> Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. [Article](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html)
> The file name ends with `.iso`

**Solution:**
