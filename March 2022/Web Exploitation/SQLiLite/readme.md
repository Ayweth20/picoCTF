### SQLiLite
**Category:** Web Exploitation - **Points:** 300 - **Solves:** ????  
**Description:** Can you login to this website? Try to login [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:62240/).   

**Hint:**
> `admin` is the user you want to login as.  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to bypass the login screen.  
So in first time, we try with basics credentials like `admin/password` to see the response's server.  
After sending the requests, a failed message is displayed on the webpage but there are others infos : the SQL request/command.

Now we can see that we need to do a SQL injection to simply bypass this screen.  
To do that let's write this : `admin/' OR '1'='1`.  
With theses infos, the request is executed like that : `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR '1'='1` so the `OR` condition bypass the password value.

The flag is just hidden in the source code.
