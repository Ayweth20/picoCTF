### Forbidden Paths
**Category:** Web Exploitation - **Points:** 200 - **Solves:** ????  
**Description:** Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:53864/). We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to find the *flag.txt* file.  
When we arrived on the webpage, there are only one input and some text :

If we write `divine-comedy.txt` (a filename displayed on the webpage) in the input text, and run the form, we can see the content file.  
So now, we have seen how the website work. We need to find the flag.txt file place.  
If we read the description, we can see that we are on the `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.php` repository and the file is on the `/flag.txt`.  
So we just need to go back on the directory tree like that : `../../../../flag.txt` and the flag is displayed
