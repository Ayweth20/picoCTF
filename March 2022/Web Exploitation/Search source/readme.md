**Category:** Web Exploitation - **Points:** 100 - **Solves:** ????  
**Description:** The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:58133/)  

**Hint:**
> How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to find the flag in the source code.  
Here we have 2 ways :  
- Mirror the website on local machine
- Analyze all source code files with a web browser

1) **Mirror the website on local machine** :  
To mirror/download a website and all pages on a local machine, we need to use this command : `wget -r http://saturn.picoctf.net:58133/`  
Now to find the flag, we just need to use the command `grep` with the start of the flag : `grep -R 'picoCTF'`  
The response is instant : `css/style.css:/** banner_main picoCTF{%flag%} **/`

2) **Analyze all source code files with Chrome browser** :  
If we choose the second way, we just need to inspect the source code and open all files of the website.  
The flag is in the file : *css/style.css* :
