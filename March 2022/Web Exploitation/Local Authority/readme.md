**Description:** Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54554/) and see what you can discover.  

**Hint:**
> How is the password checked on this website?  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to find a method to bypass or analyze the login method.  
We first try with basic credentials : `admin/password` or `admin/admin`  
But with theses credentials the login screen display the message *Log In Failed* but now we are on a new page *login.php*  
If we inspect the differents files, we can see that there is a JavaScript (*secure.js*)  
So when we analyze the file, we can see the correct login infos : `admin/strongPassword098765`  
If we return on the login screen and try to login with theses infos, we are redirected in the good page where there is the flag
