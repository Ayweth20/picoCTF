### buffer overflow 0
**Category:** Binary Exploitation - **Points:** 100 - **Solves:** ????  
**Description:**  
Smash the stack.  
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](./vuln). You can view source [here](./vuln.c/).  
And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 53935`

**Hint:**
> How can you trigger the flag to print?
> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
> Run `man gets` and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to overflow the program.  
To do that, we need to analyze the [source code](./vuln.c/)  
And after we need to run the netcat command (give in description) to put our command to take the flag :
